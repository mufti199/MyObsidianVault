# Motivation - I am....
The best form of motivation is through self-indentification. When I've indentified myself as someone who does the kind of task no matter how tedious or diificult, that is when I feel the most stable motivation to complete the task.


## The Hero's Journey
I am a person who can spend countless hours on this task to become better, similar to Edward Elrich (or the deadbeat noble). I can and will become a hero.

Just imagine what I can become in not 5, but in just 2 simple years!

### Dopamine
The best way to get dopamine is not as a consequence of completing an action but rather by the performance of an action. In other words, don't get happy because you've completed the task, be happy because you're doing the task!
