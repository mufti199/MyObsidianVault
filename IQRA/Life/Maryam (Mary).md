Maryam (Mary) was the mother of [[Isa (Jesus)]]. She is the most prominent and mentioned female figure in Islam (via the Quran) and Chritianity (via the Bible). She even has an entire surah ([[Surah Al Maryam]]) named after her.

## Lineage
In the Quran, it is mentioned that Maraym's father was the prophet Imran (Joachim) and her mother isn't mentioned by name while in the Bible it is known to be saint Anne. 

## The Miracle Birth
Maryam was informed that she would give birth to a son by the angel Jibreel (Gabriel); mentioned in the Quran ([[Surah Ali 'Imran ]]- Verse 42). She was amazed and scared by this because she was not touched by any man (did not have sexual intercourse). 

She was accused of adultry by her community but Isa spoke as a baby as one of the miracles of Allah and cleared her name. According to [[Mustafa Akyol]] her archetype is:
> An innocent, chaste woman who faces unjust allegations of adultry and displays remarkable courage, strength and belief to face it all, especially given that she already knew of the hardship she would face.

Akyol also goes onto make a connection between Maryam and [[Ayishah]] (prophet Muhammad's wife)
