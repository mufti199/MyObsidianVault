Industrilization was enabled through the realization that by specialization the availability of useful (demandable) goods could be increased drastically. Therefore, **mass specialization enabled mass production for the masses**, which is industrialization.

The industrial revolution occured in Britain, Europe and the United States of America from around 1760 to 1840.

# The Benefit
The benefit and sacrifice of industrialization both stem from specialization. 

Through secialization, people were able to make use of resources more effectively than ever before. Increase in efficient use of resources means that for the same amount of resource (time, labor, raw material, etc.) more useful goods can be produced. This means that the cost of production per unit good is decreased through specialization. 

## Feedback Loop
The greatest property of [[The Free Market]] is its feedback loop. This propety had an even greater effect during industrialization due to the number of people involved. The feedback loop took the shape of the following:

> **Increased specialization** -> Increased Efficiency -> Increased supply & Reduced costs -> Increased affordability -> Increased demand -> Increased incentive for supply ->Increased incentive for specialization -> **Increased specialization**

# The Sacrifice
## Slavery
[[Ludwig von Mises]] notes that 
From complete slaves to partial slaves
