Shariah is a set of rules and regulations that govern all aspects of life. It encompasses various subsets each dealing with different matters of life, ranging from individual to all the way up to the state.

# Divine Laws
The laws and commandments specified by Allah in the Quran and through the Sunnah. These laws are unambiguous and therefore are accepted as immutable.

# Fiqh
Fiqh (islamic jurisprudence) is a subset of Shariah that primarily deals with the following:
1. Ibaadat (devotional acts of worship), and
2. Mu'amalat (social transactions and interactions)

Fiqh is where human fallibility comes in and therefore, it is debated and revised  by scholars. It can also be adapted to changing circumstances. 

## Ijtihad
Fiqh is derived from the divine laws. The tools and mechanisms using which this is done is called Ijithad (juristic thinking). Some of the most accepted and used tools are:
1. Ijma (consensus)
2. Qiyas (analogy)

## The Four Schools
The Sunni' sect of Islam follow primarily four schools of fiqh, which are considered to be the most:
1. Hanafi
2. Maliki
3. Shafi
4. Hanbali

## Fatawa
Fatawa (singular. Fatwa) are the final conclusions of fiqh, derived by Muftis (islamic judiciary scholars).
