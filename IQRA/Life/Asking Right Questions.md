# What is a "right" question?
Good question.
- Succiently identifies what we do not know
	- within a well known area/field
- Leads to what we, the people/world, need/want

## Instituitions
- Do not appreciate.
- Too focused on testing people to provide a measurement competence.
	- So that people can make decisions based on those measurements (eg. academic acceptance, job screening, grants, social status)
