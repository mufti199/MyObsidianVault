The inventor of the Polio vaccine. He invented the vaccine without the help of any research institute or pharmaceutical company. It was almost an accomplishment of a single individual and his research associates.

Furthermore, Salk challenged the scientific standard of his time. Back then it the paradigm of vaccinology and virology claimed that a vaccine could only be made without a live (but weakend) virus. However, Salk rebuked this claim entirely as his vaccine was made from non-infectious dead viral samples.

I suspect he did not receive the Noble Prize because the scientific community was jealous and bitter of the method he used to reach his achivement.
