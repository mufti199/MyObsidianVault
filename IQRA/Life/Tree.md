A tree is a woody plant with a single vertical trunk that measures a minimum of 3 inches. Worldwide, there are about 50,000 species of trees.

# Basic Types
There are two basic types of trees:
1. Conifer
> These trees bear cone shaped fruits. Hence, the name conifers.
2. Broadleaf
> These trees generally have broad, flat leaves in all shapes and sizes.

### Evergreen & Deciduous
Trees that are green all year round are called evergreens. These usually tend to be conifers such as holly, pines (like christmas trees) and magnolias.

Trees that lose their leave in the winter, often after a beautiful change of color, are called deciduous. These usually tend to be broadleaf trees.

## Conifer
Conifers have either needles or scales instead of traditional leaves. And of course, they bear cone shaped fruits. The only two exceptions to this rule are **yews** and **junipers** which are confiers with berry-like fruits.

### Needles
Needles are long, thing and pointy leaves.
1. **Pine trees** usually have needles that grow in little bundles.
2. **Spruce trees** usually have a single needle that can be easily rolled between two fingers because of multiple sides.
3. **Fir trees** usually have a needle that can't be rolled between two fingers because of two flat sides.

### Scales
Scales are little curved shield-shaped leaves that overlap the twig.
1. **Junipers** have small blue-black, berry shaped cones.
2. **Cedars** have scales that grow on flattned sprays or all around the twig.
3. **Cypress** have leaves that may start out as needles but change to scales on mature trees.

## Broadleaf Tress
Broadleaf trees can easily be categorized but are difficult to identify as there are many variations. In order to identify a broadleaf tree, we need to take the following into account:
1. Leaf structure -> Simple, Compound (Pinnate or Palmate)
2. Leaf arrangement -> Opposite, Alternate, or Whorled
3. Leaf shape -> Linear, Cordate, Lanceolate, Reinform, Spatulate, or other
4. Leaf margins -> Entire (smooth), Serrate (saw-tooth), Lobate, or other
5. Leaf veins -> Pinnate venation or Palmate venation

### Leaf Structure
A **simple leaf** is a stem with a single leaf.
A **compound leaf** is of multiple leaves attached to the same stem.
A **doubly compound leaf** is of multiple compound leaves attached on a stem.

**Pinnate** are compound leaves arranged in rows i.e. they orignate from different points of the stem.
**Palmate** are compound leaves that originate from the same point and resemble the leaves of palm trees.

### Leaf Arrangement
Leaves can be arranged in 3 ways on the stem. They are:
1. Opposite -> The leaves grow in pairs, across from other another.
2. Alternate -> Each leaf seems to be grow a bit ahead of the other leaf.
3. Whorled -> Grow in groupings of three or more on the same level, usually in some symmetrical pattern.  

### Leaf Shape & Margins
There are about 14 different leaf shapes! And many types of margins, too!

### Leaf Viens
The venation of leaves are of similar type to that of compound leaves. They are either **pinnate** (arranged in rows; originate in different points of the midrib) or **palmate** (originate from a single point; fan-like resemblence).
