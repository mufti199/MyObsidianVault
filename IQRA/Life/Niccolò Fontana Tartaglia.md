Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia was an italian mathematician famous for his including being the second person known in the world to have solve the depressed cubic problem. The first person was [[Scipione Del Ferro]]. 

Tartaglia grew up in poverty and taught himself everything to become a famous mathematician.

# Personal Life
Born	: 1499 or 1500 
Died	: 13 December 1557

## French War
When he was a child a french soldier cut open his face causing him to have a stutter (italinan of stutter is *tartaglia*).

## Professional
Tartaglia was of a time where mathematicians prowess and reputation was determined not just by their regular work but also by [[Mathematic Duels]].

# The Depressed Cubic
Tartaglia solved the problem of the depressed cubic in a math duel, granting him celebrity status amongst mathematicians. At the time, modern algebric notation had not been made yet. Thus, his badass way of writing the general solution was in the form of a poem!

## The Solution
Tartaglia wrote the poem and sent it to [[Gerolamo Cardano]] after Cardano's pre. The following is the tranlated poem (it rhymes in italian):
>
01) _When the cube with the cose_ _beside it_ <_x_3+_px_ >  
02) _Equates itself to some other whole number,_ <=_q_>  
03) _Find two other_, _of which it is the difference._ <_u_-_v_=_q_>  
04) _Hereafter you will consider this customarily_  
05) _That their product always will be equal_ <_uv_=>  
06) _To the third of the cube of the cose net._ 3/3, instead of (_p_/3)3>  
07) _Its general remainder_ _then_  
08) _Of their cube sides_ , _well subtracted,_ <u−−√3−v√3u3−v3>  
09) _Will be the value of your principal unknown._ <=_x_>  
10) _In the second of these acts,_  
11) _When the cube remains solo_ , <_x_3=_px_+_q_>  
12) _You will observe these other arrangements:_  
13) _Of the number_ <_q_> _you will quickly make two such parts,_ <_q_=_u_+_v_>  
14) _That the one times the other will produce straightforward_ <_uv_=>  
15) _The third of the cube of the cose in a multitude,_ <_p_3/3, instead of (_p_/3)3>  
16) _Of which_ _then, per common precept,_  
17) _You will take the cube sides_ _joined together._  <u−−√3+v√3u3+v3   
18) _And this sum will be your concept._ <=_x_>  
19) _The third then of these our calculations_ <_x_3+_q_=_px_>  
20) _Solves itself with the second, if you look well after,_  
21) _That by nature they are quasi conjoined._  
22) _I found these_, _& not with slow steps,_  
23) _In thousand five hundred, four and thirty_  
24) _With very firm and strong foundations_  
25) _In the city girded around by the sea_.
