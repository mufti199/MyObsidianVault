Gerolamo Cardano is one of the most famous polymath's of the world. His greatest and most work is in the field of mathematics  

# Personal Life
Born : 24 September 1501
Died : 21 September 1576

# Profession
Cardano made his riches as a physician. His notability in the medical field was such that the aristocracy tried to lure him out of Milan.

# Ars Magna (The Great Art)
Cardano's publication, Ars Magna, pushed geometrical reasoning to its literal breaking point.

## The Depressed Cubic 
Cardano became obsessed with [[Niccol√≤ Fontana Tartaglia]] after he had heard that Tartaglia managed to solve the problem of depressed cubic. He insisted Tartaglia, through numerous letters, to reveal his method by Tartaglia refused. But Cardano eventually managed to entice Tartaglia to reveal his solution after promising an introduction with Cardano's wealthy benefactor and also swearing an oath of secreacy.

## Cardano's Method
Cardano played around with Tartaglia's algorithm and figured out the solution to the full cubic equation. Due to his oath with Tartaglia he initially could not publish it but he later conincidentally met the son-in-law of [[Scipione Del Ferro]] who showed Cardano, Del Ferro's journal were Del Ferro's solution to the depressed cubic was written. As Del Ferro's solution backdated Tartaglia's, Cardano used it to publish his solution of the full cubic equation without breaking his oath. He also gave due credit to the works of Del Ferro and Tartaglia.

## Square Root of Negatives
Many cubic equations cannot be solved without solving for the square root of negatives. Neither Tartaglia nor Cardano could figure out how to solve for them, therefore Cardano avoids these problems in his publication by saying that ***"The square roof of negatives is as subtle as it is useless."*** But about 10 years later, the famous italian engineer, [[Rafael Bombelli]] solved this problem.
