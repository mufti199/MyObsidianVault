Mathematic Duels were famous in the 14th century, especially in Italy. The duel  consisted of a set number of problems made by each mathematician. The mathematician to complete the most problems would win the duel.

## Famous Duels
One of the most famous mathematic duels is of [[Niccol√≤ Fontana Tartaglia]], during which he became the second person in the world to have solved the depressed cubic equation.

Tartaglia was challenged by a student of [[Scipione Del Ferro]], the first person to have solved the depressed cubic problem. Tartaglia knew that Scipione's student was not intelligent enough to have solved the problem on his own and had heard the rumors of Scipione having solved it. Therefore, with the belief that the problem did have a solution, Tartaglia solved it fairly quickly. *(Some say in just 2 hours!)*
