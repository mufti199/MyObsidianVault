"Shahadah" is an arabic word which means "testimony". In Islam, it refers to the following statement:

> "I testify that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"


# The First Pillar of Islam
It is the first pillar of Islam ([[The Five Pillars of Islam]]) and is considered to be the religion's gateway as any believer of the faith must first and foremost belief in this statement. It is also known as "Kalima Shahadah".

## The Structure
The Shahadah is divided into two parts:
1. There is no god but Allah
2. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah

## Source
The shahadah is not written in the Quran in its entirety; it is present in the Quran, split amongst its two parts. The first part is especially repeated throughout varous Surahs, which shows its greater importance.
