Bombelli learnt of the general solution to cubic equations through [[Gerolamo Cardano]]'s publication, Ars Magna (The Great Art). He then developed the solution to facilitate for the square root of negative numbers by making them an individual thing on their own; these individual things would later be known as imaginary numbers, coined by [[Rene Descartes]], and would together with regular number they would be called [[complex numbers]], developed by [[Leonhard Euler]].
