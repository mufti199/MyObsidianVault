Deep, fulfilling conversations are created when value can be extracted from them, through humility, critical thinking and sympathetic listening.
<br>
### What gives the conversation its value?
Usually, new ideas, concepts and perspectives.

### How can we more frequently have such conversations?
A seemingly winning forumla is to be humble. To have the humility to recognize that everyone in the world has a unique perspective because of how they have lived their lives and have grown up in their environment, therefore anyone can have something significant to contribute even if they are a toddler.

### Other elements of a great conversation?
1. Critical thinking
	- Indentify and address bias or gaps in knowledge. 
2. Sympathetic listening
	- "Am I really understanding from that other person's point of view" - Adam Smith.
	- This has to be done while resisting the urge to find the flaws in the other peron's logic.

### My Opinion
I agree with these elements and the reasons of why they help create deep, fulfilling conversations. However, in order to do both **or** by doing both effectively (kind of like an closed feedback loop) another essential component comes into play, which is [[Asking Right Questions]].

Furthermore, it is important to note that, there are conversation that might not have much value in terms of insights but can still have carry a profound experience. These types of conversations are usually very rare and are highly dependent upon the person(s) and setting.
