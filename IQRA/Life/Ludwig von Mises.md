# The Free Market
Mises was a great proponent for the free market. He believed that everything should be privatized and that government should only play a role in the defense of people and property, strictly within its territorial area.

## Value Determination
According to Mises, in order for any resource to be used efficiently, its value must be determined.
> Jordan Peterson comments that if a resource is not utilized efficiently then it cannot be used. This is because the users of the resource will stop due to the lack of productivity / usefulness.

The free market is the best known mechanism for determining a resource's value.

## Private Property
In order for the free market to function properly, resources must be privatized i.e. people must have the right to own private property. This is because the fundamental idea of a free market, demand and supply, can only be established through free trade.
