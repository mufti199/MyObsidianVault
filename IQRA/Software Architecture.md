# Why is being well-architected important?
According to [Cost of a Data Breach Report 2020, IBM Security, Ponemon Institute](https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/cost-data-breach-report/#/), Customer PII was the most frequently, and costliest compromised type of record per latest data breach study. The best way to avoid such incidents is by running a well-architected cloud workload.

# The Five Pillars
The five pillars of well-architected cloud worklouds:
1. Security
2. Performance
3. Operational Excellence
4. Reliability
5. Cost Opitmization

## Azure Well-Architected Framework

Microsoft's preferred achieving this is through their Azure Well-Architected Framework, which consists of:
1. [Azure Well-Architected Review](https://aka.ms/wellarchitected/review)
2. [Design Principles](https://aka.ms/wellarchitected/designprinciples)
3. [Azure Advisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview)
4. [Reference Architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/browse/)
5. [Documentation](https://aka.ms/architecture/framework)
6. Partners, Support & Service Offers

## Workload Quality Inhibitors
Business requirements influence decisions about workload architectures.
1. Security
	- No access control mechanism (authentication & authorization)
	- No security threat detection mechanism
	- Lack of security thread response plan
	- No encryption process

2. Perfomance
	- No monitoring for new services and/or current workloads health
	- No design for scaling 
	- Lack of rigor and guidance for technology and architecture selection

3. Operational Excellence
	- No rapid incident identification
	- No deployment automation
	- No communication mechanisms & dashboards
	- Unclear expectations and business outcomes
	- No visibility on root cause for events

4. Reliability
	- Unclear on resiliency capabilities for improved architecture design
	- Lack of data back up practices
	- No monitoring of current workload health
	- No resiliency testing
	- No support for disaster recovery

5. Cost Optimization
	- Lack of cost and usage monitoring
	- Unstructured billing management
	- Budget reductions

# How to get started?
In order to improve any workload (cloud or on-premises) the first step is collecting data of the existing system. This data can then be analyzed to identify optimization opportunities. A great method of recognizing what data needs to be collected and how it can to be analyzed is via [Azure Well-Architected Review](https://aka.ms/wellarchitected/review).

The review is a web-based assessment which examines the five pillars and provides specific guidance for improvement. The company/team should only focus on one pillar at a time. This ensures that improvement plans can be discussed throughout the company/team and optimal implementations are made.
