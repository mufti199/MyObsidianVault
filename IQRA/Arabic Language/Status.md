# Status
There are three kinds of statuses in Ism:
1. Raf'
> The ***doer*** of an act.
2. Nasb
> The ***details***  of an act.  Additional information.
3. Jarr
> Any Ism after 'of'. 


### Jarr
The possessor of something. The word 'of' can be implicit or explict in a sentence. For example:
> Explicit: House of Allah 
> Implicit: His mug <-> Mug of his

In these examples, "Allah" and "his" are the Jarr words i.e. the possessors.

## Endings of Ism
The ending of an Ism detemines whether it is Raf', Nasb, Jarr. There can be two kinds of endings:
1. Normal (Singular) -> ***aa (an), ee (en), uu (un)***
2. Combination
	- Two:  ***ani, aini***
	- Plural: ***uuna, eena*** or ***aatuun, aateen*** for [[Feminine]]
	- 

> In Arabic, plural is more than 2 (unlike, more than 1, in english)
> Also, ***uuna*** and ***eena*** are only used for people (+ angels and jinns)
> While, ***aatuun*** and ***aateen*** do not have that limit.
