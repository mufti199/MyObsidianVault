# Status
There are three kinds of statuses in Ism:
1. Raf'
> The ***doer*** of an act.
2. Nasb
> The ***details***  of an act.  Additional information.
3. Jarr
> Any Ism after 'of'. 

#### Jarr
The possessor of something. The word 'of' can be implicit or explict in a sentence. For example:
> Explicit: House of Allah 
> Implicit: His mug <-> Mug of his

In these examples, "Allah" and "his" are the Jarr words i.e. the possessors.

## Method of Identification
The ending of an Ism is used to determine whether it is Raf', Nasb, or Jarr. 

There can be two kinds of endings:
1. Normal (Singular) -> ***aa (an), ee (en), uu (un)***
2. Combination
	- Pair (two):  ***ani, aini*** or ***tani, taini***
	- Plural: ***uuna, eena*** or ***aatuun, aateen*** 

> In Arabic, plural is more than 2 (unlike, more than 1, in english)

> Also, ***uuna*** and ***eena*** are only used for people (+ angels and jinns)
> While, ***aatuun*** and ***aateen*** do not have that limit.

Refer to [[Arabic Language - Masculine]] and [[Arabic Language - Feminine]].

## Light, Heavy and Irrelevant
A status can also be light, heavy or irrelevant. The default for a status is to be heavy. This is when the Ism ends in an "n"-sound such as ***uuna*** or ***aateen***.

A status is classified as irrelevant when the word starts with "Al" (The), such as "Al-hamd" (The praise). All words that start with "Al" are fully flexible. 

Lastly, a status is said to be light when the words traditional "n"-sound is removed. This can only occur under special circumstances.

## Flexibility
Most Ism's can have various endings depending upon their status, however there is a concept of flexibiilty that exists within Ism which dictates what kind of ending the word can have. This concept **only applies to singular** Ism.

There are three kinds of flexibility:
1. Fully Flexible
> 1. 
> 2. If the word has an "Al" (The), it is fully flexible.
> 2. Three letter names or places are fully flexible.
2. [[Partially Flexible]]
> Partially flexible words must be light (the "n"-sound is removed) and cannot have the "e"-sound at the end, even for a Jar.
>
> There are seven categories were partially flexible words are used. However, for the study of the Quran, we can focus on only two categories:
> 1. Non-arab names (people, angels, etc.), such as Jibrael
> 2. Places
>
> ## Exceptions
> 1. If the word has an "Al" (The), it is fully flexible.
> 2. Three letter names or places are fully flexible.
> *Take caution when counting the letters of an arabic word.*

3. Infexible
