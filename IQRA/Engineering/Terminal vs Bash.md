# Terminal
When computers were first built, they were too big to be kept in small rooms and too expensive to be bought multiple times. Therefore, an office would have a few computers which would be accessed via terminals. These terminals were literally just a keyboard and monitor, connected to the on-premises network.

The following is an example of terminal:

Devices such as these were called video terminals which were the successor to hard-copy terminals. A hard copy terminal was literally just a keyboard and printer; the output of a command would be printed, in order to be seen. This is why in many programming languages outputting text for display is the command "print".

# Bash
The shell has always been there - from the dawn of Unix, it was the program that was run after you entered your login name and password on the terminal, to access the central computer. The first shell program was the [Thompson shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_shell) (`sh`) from 1971, which in 1977 was superseded by [Bourne shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell), also called `sh`. Early on, it was designed so that that this was just another program that could be updated easily, and that users could run their own program instead of the default shell.

The GNU project then produced from scratch an improved shell called `bash`, short for [Bourne-again shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29), which Apple decided to ship with MacOS X too.

Back in 1970s, the distinction was clear: a terminal was that what seemed like 30 kg piece of solid cast iron frame wrapped in cream-colour plastic case with a glass display and keyboard in front of you, or even a device with just a keyboard and printer, whereas a shell was a program running on the main computer interpreting your commands.
