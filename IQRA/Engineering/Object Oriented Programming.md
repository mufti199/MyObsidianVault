### Objects

-   Object methods are logic so they technically aren't properties.
-   If an object has more than 1 method then it is said to have behavior.
-   Objects can be made using:
    -   Object literals
    -   Factory functions
    -   Constructor functions
    -   Class

### Properties - JavaScript

_Primitives (aka value types)_ are copied by their values. Number, String, Boolean, Symbol, Null, Undefined

_Objects (aka reference types)_ are copied by their reference (pointer). Object, Function and Array

## Benefits of OOP

1.  Reduce complexity + Increase reusability by, revoming spaghetti code (functions inter-dependended on other functions)
2.  Reduce complexity further + Isolate the impact of changes
3.  Eliminate redundant code (DRY)
4.  Refactor code
