# SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to interact with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). It can be used to instruct the RDBMS to perform tasks such as:

1.  Create and manage databases
2.  Perform administration tasks (security, user management, import/export, and more)

The implementation of SQL varies between systems (similar to the SQL standard).

SQL is a hybrid language. It is a combination of the following languages:

-   Data Query Language (DQL)
-   Data Definition Language (DDL)
-   Data Control Language (DCL)
-   Data Manipulation Language (DML)

# Table Keys

There are many types of keys:

- Primary Key
	Unique key for each row

	- Surrogate key
	A primary key that is not a natural or real item/data/attribute.

	- Natural key
	Primary key made using natural or real item/data/attribute.

- Foreign key
A column of key that are the primary keys of another table. A table can have foreign keys that refer to the primary keys of the same table.

- Composite key: A primary made using a combination of two or more keys/attributes.

> Good practice - Make the primary key, foreign keys so that relations can be established.
