# Types of Design Patterns
There are 3 types of design patterns:

1. Creational 
Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
[Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)

[Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)
