AppImage is an application format that provides “native” binaries for Linux users just the same way they could do for other operating systems.

It allows packaging applications for any common Linux based operating system, e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora etc. The images come with all the dependencies that cannot be assumed to be part of each target system in a recent enough version and will run on most Linux distributions without any further modifications.
