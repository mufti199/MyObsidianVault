A bezier curve is an algorithm used in computer graphics, fonts, animations, etc. It uses the intersection between points (linear, quadratic, and more) to form the curves.

## Bezier Surfaces
A bezier curve can be combined with a Bezier spline or generalized higher dimernsions to create Bezier surfaces.

# Pierre Bezier
The bezier curve is an algorithm made by Pierre Bezier back in the 1960s. Bezier was a designer for the car manufacturer Renault. He noticed that it was particularly difficult to draw curves using CAD and therefore developed the algoirthm as a solution.
